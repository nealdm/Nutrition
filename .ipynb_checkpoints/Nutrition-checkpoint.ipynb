    "\n",
    "## Objective Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of protein-based meal gives me the most protein per serving?\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of recipe gives the largest 'healthy fat' to 'unhealthy fat' ratio?\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What has been done\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already lots of resources easily available online to help you search for recipes.  Many of these allow you to search recipes based on the type of recipe you want (comfort food, quick and easy, Mexican, etc.), and some let you search for recipes based on what ingredients you have in your fridge, allowing the user to say \"I have milk, eggs, raisins, chicken, and rice- What can I make?\"  However, no recipe search databases are readily available that give the nutritional value of the recipes."

    "#### How this is different\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are interested in creating a table that will help us sort through recipes based on nutritional value so that in a future project we can work on finding a set of recipes to match specific nutritional needs.  The table will enable us to answer the above questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create the table with information about the nutritional values of recipes by starting with two specific resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first resource pulls from recipe text files that used to be offered at the Recipe Library at MasterCook.com.  It is a website that contains a list of links, where each link leads to a text file containing many recipes that all fit in the same 'category' of food.  This is the resource we will be scraping from to collect a reasonable sample of recipes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second resource is a website called nutritionvalue.org (NutritionValue) that we will use to search for the nutritional content of the ingredients used in the recipes mentioned above.  NutritionValue allows us to search, for example, \"banana\", which will then return a list of links of all the various brands of bananas that it has in the database.  Each one of these links then leads to a page that contains all the nutritional information (calorie content, protein content, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of that particular banana selection.\n",

    "#### Validity of Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that both of these resources are appropriate for the question at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is valid because it contains recipes that were created by various users, and offers a variety of recipes.  Therefore, the sample of recipes is well distributed.  It is also a suitable source because it offers a particularly easy way to download a large number of recipes with consistent formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second resource is valid because it pulls its data from the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference.  It has a broad range of ingredients available to search and is also very detailed in its nutritional content breakdown, which makes it suitable for this project.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Table Construction Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "|Category|Recipe|Serving Size|Salt|Sugar|...|Ingredient n|\n",
    "|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n",
    "|Chowders|Clam Chowder|4|...|...|...|...|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recipe will have an associated category, serving size, and ingredient columns.  Each ingredient column shown here actually represents a 'batch' of many columns that contain: one column for how much of the ingredient is present, and a column for how much of each nutritional property (protein content, vitamin content, Calorie count, etc.) is contained per 100 grams of that ingredient."

The recipes consist of the title, ingredients, and an explanation portion on how to 'make' the recipe.  The portion of each recipe we will be using is just the quantitative portion, for which an example is given at the right.\n",
