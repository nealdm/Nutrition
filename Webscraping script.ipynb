    "Identify potential problems with the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Evaluate the source--is it reliable or not? why? Evaluate potential biases and other problems with the data (e.g. political data gathered by a particular party trying to get a particular result. Or positive pharmaceutical data from the company selling the pharmaceutical) What will you do to deal with these problems?\n",
    "   \n",
    "Answer for Nutrition: The source for the nutritional value is medium reliable. It is great because we have lots of data and we didn't get band from using it. It lacks because it is not consistent in reporting the same nutrion categories for all foods, which means we have a lot of NaN values. We are going to try to refine our scraping algorithm to be more selective in its choice for ingredients. We will also attemp to scrape from a more reliable source that temporarilly blocked us because we were still learning how to webscrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer for recipes: The source of my data came from an online recipe website.  Therefore, it likely has 'reliable' recipes, but they may be biased (inasmuch that they could be 'better' or 'worse' than recipes from a physical textbook, or ones that might be accessed without payment.  The method of data collection should not influence it's contents.  However, the recipes have alot of human error. I used Regex to try to parse through the ingredients lists and measurement units as best I could, but there are still likely many hidden issues.  I don't see any reason to 'deal with' these small inconsistancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Are there missing results or other things that look wrong? why? what will you do to deal with these? Values that are out of range (e.g. percentages not in 0-100,  or counts that are negative or much bigger than physically possible) must be  identified and removed or corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer for Nutrition: One difficulty we ran into so far is the string \"<1 mg\" which we created a new feature that has a 1 if the value is greater than one and 0 if is <1. Now we can keep track of the items that seem like they have much information but in reality could produce an interesting result. Another difficulty is the serving size because it is very different (some unconventional) in the way they are recorded. The plan right now is to make them all the same unit and have a conversion dataframe that can make the adjustments according to the recipe instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer for Recipes: The recipes could still be cleaned up to make the ingredients uniform across the board.  There are some 'missing' values for quantities, but these shouldn't be a problem as long as the ingredients they are associated with are things like 'pinch of salt' or 'garnish to taste'.  There are no values out of range I am aware of.  Mostly, the fine tuning work will be to make the data uniform in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the suitability of your data for answering the questions in the proposal.  If it is not suitable, adjust the questions or acquire new data as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer for both: The data is well suited for the suggested problem for this semester. We have categorical recipes and the nutritional values to do statiscal anylisis to identify healthier type of meals. We will create distribution graphs to discover the 'weight' of different ingredients on recipes.  We also would like to learn which category has the highest variance in ingredient use.\n",

    "Revise any other aspects of your proposal in light of what you have learned from examining the data.\n",
