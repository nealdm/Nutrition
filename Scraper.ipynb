In a large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, 3/4 cup chopped pecans and vanilla on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking powder and mix well, using low speed. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Slightly flatten by pressing balls onto ungreased cookie sheets; pinch tops to point to resemble acorns. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 375.  Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. In top of a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate chips, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat; keep double boiler over water. Dip large ends of cooled cookies into melted chocolate, then roll in chopped pecans. Cool to set chocolate. Yield: 3 dozen.

Add egg and remaining ingredients. Beat at low speed until well mixed, constantly scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Shape dough into a ball, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill 3-4 hours. 2-Lightly grease 2 large cookie sheets, turn oven to 350. On lightly floured surface using a floured rolling pin, roll 1/2 of dough 1/4-inch thick. Keep other half refrigerated. With a 3-inch cookie cutter, cat as many cookies as you can; reserve trimmings. With pancake turner, carefully place cookies on cookie sheets. Bake for 12 minutes or until edges are light brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Repeat with other half of dough and trimmings. 3-Prepare FROSTING: In a large bowl using mixer at low speed beat 5 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 4 egg whites just until mixed. Turn speed to high and beat until stiff. Divide dough into small bowls and tint each with food coloring of your choice. If necessary, add a little water for spreading ease. Keep all bowls covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. 4-Decorate cookies: place cookies on waxed paper lined cookie sheets. With small and medium artist's brushes, paint the cookies. Allow cookies to dry completely, about 2 hours. Store in tightly covered containers. First Place winner, Sarah Cristal,age 13, Spring Valley Ca at the Del Mar county fair 1993.  Jo Anne Merrill\r\n",

      "In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and cream cheese until fluffy.  Add 3 tablespoons honey and mix well.  Mix in the flour until the dough holds together.  Form the dough into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.      Preheat oven to 350 degrees; line cookie sheets with parchment paper and grease the parchment.  Divide the dough into fourths.  On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough, one piece at a time, into a 9-inch circle.  In a small bowl or cup, combine 2 tablespoons honey and lemon juice; mix well.  Brush the dough with some of the honey mixture; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over the entire surface.  In another small bowl, combine the almonds, dried cherries and the remaining 3 tablespoons honey; mix well.  Spread 1/4 the almond mixture onto the circle of dough, stopping 1/2-inch from the outer edge.  Cut the circle into eight wedges.  Starting at the wide outer edge, roll up each triangle jelly roll style, toward the tip.  Gently bend both ends to form a crescent. Place on prepared cookie sheet; refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer.  Repeat with the remaining dough, honey-lemon mixture, cinnamon and filling.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the pan and cool on wire racks.  Unbaked crescents may be stored in a freezer-safe container or bags and frozen for up to 3 months.  Thaw before baking.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).\r\n",

      "1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the flour, baking soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. 3.  In the bowl of a mixer, cream the butter. Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat. Add the vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate and stir to blend. 4.  Stir in the dry ingredients and the milk by hand. When just blended, mix in the walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough for 30 minutes before rolling. 5.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a cookie sheet. 6.  To form the cookies, scoop out a portion of dough and roll out on a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch thick, cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll scraps and cut again. 7.  Place on cookie sheet (leave room for expansion) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch for any hot spots in the oven and don't let these cookies overbrown. VARIATION:  For the Brownie Cookie Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the dough briefly. Lightly grease the back side of a large baking sheet. Roll the dough out onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked product will crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and  cool completely. Roll over the cookie with a rolling pin until it is crushed to a fine crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of crumbs.)  Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix it into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual cookie crumb crusts for the \"Kit's Chocolate Mousse\" recipe by using a large muffin pan.  Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.\r\n",

      "Preheat oven to 375 degrees; line 4 cookie sheets with foil and lightly grease the foil.  In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the brown sugar, shortening, milk and vanilla extract until well blended. Beat in the egg.  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking soda.  With a spoon, stir into the shortening mixture just until blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans.  Divide the dough into quarters; divide each quarter into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 1-inch ball. Arrange the balls on the cookie sheets almost touching to form an 8-inch circle.  Flatten the balls slightly with your fingers.  Repeat with the remaining balls to make 3 more wreaths.  Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the wreaths are lightly browned.  Do not overbake.  Cool completely before removing from the cookie sheet.      Meanwhile, prepare the icing.  In a small bowl with the mixer on medium speed, beat the powdered sugar, shortening, milk and corn syrup until smooth.  If too thick, thin with a little milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.  The icing may be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 week. Makes 1 1/2 cups.  Spread or pipe the icing over the cooled wreaths.  Cut the red and green candies as needed for flowers and leaves.  Place in clusters around the wreath. Makes 4 wreaths.\r\n",

Pat each ball into a 6-inch round, about 1/2-inch thick, on a lightly floured surface.  Cut each round into 16 wedges.  Arrange the wedges on an ungreased cookie sheet about 1/2 inch apart with the pointed ends toward the center.  Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Immediately remove from the cookie sheet.  Cool completely on wire racks.  Place the remaining 1/2 cup pistachios in a small dish.  Place the chocolate and shortening in a small microwavable bowl. Microwave uncovered on medium power for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until the mixture can be stirred smooth and is drizzling consistency.  Dip one edge of each cookie into the chocolate, then into the nuts.  Place on waxed paper until the chocolate is firm.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B). \r\n",

On floured large cookie sheet, with floured rolling pin, roll remaining ball of dough into a rectangle slightly larger than 15x13-inch. Trim side to make 15x12 inch rectangle. Using dull edge of knife, score rectangle lengthwise into 3 strips; score each strips crosswise into 5 rectangles. Decorate center of each rectangle by pressing favorite holiday cookie cutter into dough by making sure not to cut all the way through. (Use the same cookie cutter for all rectangles or choose as many different ones to decorate rectangles as you like.) Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until edges begin to brown.  Cook on cookie sheet on wire rack 2 minutes;  slice onto rack to cook completely. Repeat with remaining dough and sugar. When cool, break each large rectangle into 15 smaller rectangle along scored line. Makes 45 crackers.\r\n",

      "\"The perfect cooky should have a slight crunch on the outside and be soft and very moist on the inside.  It should be thick enough that you can feel your teeth sink into it.  Its flavor should perfectly blend the sweetness of a buttery dough with the semisweetness of the chocolate.\"  This is the standard Deryl Bear sets at his Hungry Bear Cookies store in Corte Madera and Fresno, California.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before entering the professional cooky business.  Mr. Bear experimented with batch after batch of cookies to find the secret to moist chewy chocolate chip cookies.  He found his answer in a combination of recipe proportions, shaping technique, and baking precision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His recipe portions are much like those for traditional chocolate chip cookies, except that he adds more flour and chocolate.  The extra flour helps maintain a plump shape and keeps the cooky from spreading.  Brief baking at a high temperature forms a crust on the outside and maintains a moist, chewy interior.\r\n",
